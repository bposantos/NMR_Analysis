# NMR Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter (Colab) notebooks with Python code for the analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data. They help processing, interpreting and plotting data.

## Notebooks

### 1. T1_Relaxation_Analysis.ipynb

This notebook covers the fundamental analysis of NMR T1 relaxation data. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Curve fitting using the T1 relaxation model.
- Extraction of T1 relaxation time constants.
- Visualization of fitted curves and results.

## Usage

To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. For a hassle-free experience, consider using Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of each notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter (for local execution)
- (Optional) Google Colab account for cloud-based execution
